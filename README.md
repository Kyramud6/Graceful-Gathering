A PHP-based e-commerce web application designed for **wedding services**, allowing users to browse, book, and review vendors.  
Built with a focus on smooth user experience and clear, elegant interface design.

## 🖥️ Overview
This project was developed as a **group coursework project** for a university subject.  
The system provides three main sections:

- **User Site:** For customers to browse, book, and review wedding services.  
- **Vendor Page:** For vendors to manage their own services, pricing, and availability.  
- **Admin Panel:** For administrators to oversee system management and approve vendors.  

I was mainly responsible for the **User Site**, including front-end design and back-end integration.
