This project was developed as a **group coursework project** for a university subject.  
The system provides three main sections:

- **Vendor Page:** For vendors to manage their own services, pricing, and availability.
- **Admin Panel:** For administrators to oversee system management and approve vendors.

I was mainly responsible for the **User Site**, including front-end design and back-end integration.
